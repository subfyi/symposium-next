                                                Because of the effects of COVÄ°D-19 Pandemic, it may not be possible to make the symposium with normal
                                                procedure. Therefore, as an organizing committee we offer an asynchronous online presentation chance
                                                to our participants.
                                                The steps of online presentation are explained here:

                                                <li> The corresponding authors (presenters) will prepare their presentation in mp4 video format with
                                                    their own live images and voices. Any program creating mp4 format videos available in your
                                                    computer or phones may be used for the preparation of your videos. The presentation language must
